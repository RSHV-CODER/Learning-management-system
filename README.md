# learning management system
A Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application or platform designed to facilitate the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses or training programs.
# features

# Educators can create courses
Educators, when signed in, should easily manage courses:
Create a Course: Begin by providing a name and description for your course.
Build Chapters: Organize your course into chapters (like chapters in a book) for clear structure.
Add Pages: Populate each chapter with pages. For example, in the "Algebra Basics" chapter, add pages such as "Introduction to Algebra" and "Solving Equations."

# Students can sign-up, sign in, and sign out
For students who are new to the application:
Sign up: If they don't already have an account, students can sign up effortlessly. They need to provide their name, email address, and create a password to get started on their learning journey.
If they're returning users:
Sign in: For those with an existing account, users can use their registered email and password to access their courses.
Additionally:
Sign out: Whether they've completed their learning session or simply want to take a break, all users should have the flexibility to log out when they'd like to.
 
 # Course enrollment and content access
Enroll in a Course: Students should be able to enroll in a course to gain access to its content and participate in the learning experience.
View chapters list without enrolling: Before enrolling, students should have the ability to see the list of chapters within a course for a preview of its table of contents.

# Display enrolled courses:
The courses a student is enrolled in should be displayed in a separate/dedicated section for easy access and navigation.

# Marking as Complete
Mark Pages as Complete: Allow students to mark pages as completed to track their learning progress.

# Progress Status
Show Progress Status: Implement a feature allowing students to view their progress status in courses they are enrolled in. One possible way to do this is by displaying the completion percentage, calculated based on the number of pages marked as complete in the course.
View reports
Educators should have access to reports that display the number of students enrolled in their course(s) and indicate their relative popularity based on enrollment numbers.

# Manage your account
For account security:
Change password: All users should be able to change their own password.
